<h5> Alyssa Chung</h5>
			<p class="bodycenter">
				My name is Alyssa Chung. I grew up in the San Fransico bay area with my two immigrant parents and brother. My first introduction to art was in kindergarten, where we were taught drawing in our curriculum. With my love for drawing, I took up the artist role in group projects. My role was to design the posters and visual aspects of our presentations, which was my introduction to design. However, I did not recognize my love for design until high school when I started to fall in love with makeup product packaging.  This love for packaging design compelled me to study Visual Communication Design and Studio Art at San Fransico State University. Although my love of design stems from packaging, I have grown to love all kinds of design. Now I am developing my skills as a designer and my passion for art in hopes to merge the two to create beautiful designs that are not only visually appealing but functional. I want to push the lines of art and design, and bring art into the world of design in ways it never has been.
