						Poster Designs<br>
						2023<br>
						Task: Design a 3 posters and 2 instagram posts using a tool and a word. The tool is to be created using redux drawing methods. 
						<br>Description: For the vector of my pliers I decided to make them look cartoon-like by rounding all the edges and avoiding using sharp lines. 
						I also took inspiration from anime drawings and used a simple line and dot as highlight to add depth and dimension to the handles of the pliers. 
						As for the colors I went for a green color palette to give my poster a natural and earthy mood because when I think of tools I think of crafts and natural materials. 
						And the word I choose was "grab" because the shapes of the word grab are similar to the shapes of pliers: circles and rectangles. 
						The type face for the word is interstate black italic.
						The boldness of interstate compliments the boldness of the pliers, while the sharp edges of interestae contrasts the softness of the pliers.

						I wanted to discuss the idea of personas.

						Product Design<br>
						2021<br>
						Task:  Design an aesthetic packaging that can protect an egg when being dropped off a
						two story building. No commerical packaging is allowed.<br>
						Description: 
						The egg house is meant to be a safe place for the egg as homes are seen as safe place. 
						In order to design the interior packaging 
						I decided to use a tube mechanism so that the egg will stay in place, but can move so that there is no blunt impact on the egg when it hits the ground.
						The tube design disperses the force on the egg. If the egg where to take all the force of imppact on to one spot then it would break.
